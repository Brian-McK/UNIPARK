UniPark is a assistive technology smart car parking system that uses sensors to identify vehicles.
UniPark is currently targeted at college car parks. Users can register in our app to use their car registration or student/staff id to enter the car park. Payment is automatically calculated for the user. Users who do not adopt the app will still have access to the car park through traditional ticket systems.

Unipark uses a camera running OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read vehicle registrations and charge the associated accounts. In the event that a user's registration cannot be found, they are given the option to scan their student/staff card at the entrance or exit to lift the barrier.
